        My name is <strong>Dateh Ambe</strong>, and I‚Äôm a second-year BCom Information Systems and Mathematical Statistics student at the University of the Western Cape.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in tech began in grade 7 when I built my first game on Scratch to help kids learn the alphabet. That small project sparked a passion for using technology to solve real-world problems ‚Äî a passion that‚Äôs grown with every line of code I‚Äôve written since.
      </p>
      <p>
        In high school, I was introduced to Java, HTML, and basic SQL. Over the past year, I‚Äôve built on that foundation by learning Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and CSS, allowing me to create full-stack web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on include an athletics management platform for my high school, <strong>FestivalPass V1</strong> ‚Äî a multi-organisational festival system for ticketing and vendor applications, <strong>Read Me When You Need Me</strong> ‚Äî a personal site I made as a gift, and <strong>EazyCuts</strong> ‚Äî a booking system for my local barbershop to manage appointments.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current goals are to deepen my backend development skills, expand my tech stack, and secure internship opportunities that allow me to keep growing as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I‚Äôm a track and field athlete for UWC, and I enjoy playing PC games ‚Äî which gives me a break while keeping me sharp in problem-solving.
